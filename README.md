## Notes

This project helped me understanding the functionality of App.css versus index.css. Overall, I learned the fundamentals of front-end using React. I also practised my skills in using Copilot to help with the programming progress, which saved me a lot of times. 

The biggest challenge for me was the CSS. I have never been really good with CSS, so even figuring simple things out (for example how to have images of the same size, which I didn't do that well on this project) was challenging for me. Copilot also isn't really good with CSS, and because the visuals only stay in my head, meaning I have a hard describing what I want to Copilot, the styling part became even harder. This is very unfortunate because I love designing and the idea of front-end designing is fascinating, so I am trying every day to learn CSS better.
